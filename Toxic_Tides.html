You've lost contact with friends and family, and your self-esteem is at an all-time low. Skyler controls what you wear, who you talk to, and where you go.

The breakup is messy and public. While initially painful, being away at college gives you perspective. You start rebuilding your self-esteem and make new friends. With time and distance, you recognize how toxic the relationship was. You eventually start dating again, now better at recognizing red flags.</p>

Skyler's control extends to your hobbies, clothing choices, and even family interactions. When Skyler cheats on you, you blame yourself: "If I were better, this wouldn't have happened." You stay in the relationship, constantly trying to earn Skyler's approval, never feeling good enough.</p>

You live in constant anxiety, performing to Skyler's expectations while feeling increasingly worthless. When Skyler eventually shares your private photos anyway as "punishment" for a minor transgression, you feel devastated but powerless to respond. The experience leaves deep emotional scars.</p>

Skyler's behavior escalates slowly - more controlling behavior, more put-downs disguised as "concern," occasional physical intimidation. You tell yourself you can handle it, that you're strong enough to take it. But the constant stress affects your grades, sleep, and mental health. Years later, you recognize the relationship as abusive, but the patterns have affected your ability to form healthy relationships.</p>
                <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Abuse often escalates gradually. Minimizing concerning behavior allows it to continue. Trust your instincts when something feels wrong.</p>`,

They help you develop a safety plan and connect with resources. You end the relationship with Skyler, who initially tries to win you back with promises and gifts, then escalates to threats. With continued counseling and support from family and friends, you rebuild your self-esteem. While the experience leaves scars, you learn to recognize healthy relationships and set firm boundaries.</p>

With adult intervention, Skyler backs down and stops contacting you. Your parents help you get counseling to process the experience.

You become an advocate against relationship violence, sharing your story to help others.</p>
